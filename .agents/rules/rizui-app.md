The rizui CLI command (@../user_interface/management/commands/rizui.py) is intended to be used by the end-users of this application.
It's UI should be user friendly, intuitive, easy to use, without clutter.
There should be only one way of doing things, only one solution for a problem.
Navigation is done using the keyboard strictly.
Use the rich library for designing and implementing the UI.
Rich is documented here: https://github.com/Textualize/rich
